Software Engineering course. Your objective in this project is to apply the concepts you have learned (and will learn) in the class to improve an existing software system. You will reverse engineering the design of the system and refactor it following grounded software engineering principles. You will use some tools to analyze the code and collect metrics to aid this process.</p><p>Music, a web-based music server will serve as the testing ground for the project. The app can be used to organize your music collection and download music from different sources (well, that’s what it can do for now). You can find the original repository at <a href="https://github.com/sismics/music">https://github.com/sismics/music</a>. We will use a class-specific fork which has been slightly streamlined for ease of use.</p><p>The project also contains a bonus component, which although optional is encouraged to be attempted, as these marks can help you make up for marks lost in other components.</p><h1 id="github-classroom"> <a href="#github-classroom" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="github-classroom"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> GitHub Classroom</h1><p>You have already completed the first step of the project. At this point all of you should be part of a team. If not, quickly follow the instructions in <a href="https://courses.iiit.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=32017">moodle</a> section to join your team.</p><p>Your team will be assigned a private repository on GitHub. This is where you will be working on the project.</p><h1 id="specification"> <a href="#specification" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="specification"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Specification</h1><h2 id="1-mining-the-repository"> <a href="#1-mining-the-repository" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="1-mining-the-repository"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 1 Mining the repository</h2><p>Music is organized in several components, and to make meaningful improvements and contributions to it we need to become familiar with its structure and organization. The first task revolves around this.</p><p>Consider the following features -</p><ol><li><p>User management - Several users can use the same Music server for managing their libraries. Music thus has a user management system, with users needing to login to add music to the library. In its current state, it is quite rudimentary. The users share the same library rather than having their specific libraries, and the only way to create new accounts is through the admin account.</p><li><p>Library Management - Wouldn’t be much of a music application without this. Users can add songs to Music with a two-step process. First, new music is imported in one of two ways - uploading local files, or downloading files from external sources. Once the file is imported, they can be added to the library after adding metadata information. Users can also edit existing songs. They can change the metadata information, add album cover art, or add the songs to new playlists.</p><li><p>Last.fm integration - Last.fm is an online service that, according to Wikipedia, “using a music recommender system called ‘Audioscrobbler’, builds a detailed profile of each user’s musical taste by recording details of the tracks the user listens to, either from Internet radio stations, or the user’s computer or many portable music devices”. Music allows users to link their Last.fm profile, and sync their listening history with it.</p><li><p>Administrator features - In addition to the above features that are available to all users, the administrator has further privileges. To be precise the features that we are concerned with are - they can create and delete user accounts and change the local directory to which the music is stored, or add new directories.</p></ol><p><em>Task 1- Identify the classes responsible for these features, and document their functionality and behavior. Use UML class diagrams (you may need multiple) along with OOP concepts such as inheritance, association, aggregation etc. with an appropriate level of abstraction to paint a clear and concise picture of the system. Present observations and comments such as points of strengths and weaknesses of the system as part of this. You will be evaluated on the completeness and correctness of your documentation</em></p><h2 id="1e-bonus---transition-system"> <a href="#1e-bonus---transition-system" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="1e-bonus---transition-system"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 1E Bonus - Transition System</h2><p>This is a bonus question. Marks you obtain here can make up for marks you lose in other components in the course.</p><p><em>Task 1E - Using the Transition Systems approach for modeling behavior, document the behavior of the four features (think of them as subsystems) by modeling each of them as a transition system. Given that these subsystems interact with each other to provide the intended functionality, also describe the connections amongst various U (actions) and Y (observables), in equation form as well as in diagram form.</em></p><h2 id="2-analysis"> <a href="#2-analysis" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="2-analysis"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2 Analysis</h2><p>We now know how Music works. The next task is to know how <em>well</em> it works. For this, we will use automatic code evaluation tools to help with this.</p><h3 id="2a-design-smells"> <a href="#2a-design-smells" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="2a-design-smells"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2a Design Smells</h3><p>Design smells are structures and patterns in code that while not incorrect, are indicative of violating fundamental design principles. These can hinder development by leading to recurring problems down the line and should be avoided. Many automated tools exist to determine these. We will use Sonarqube for this project. The project repository contains instructions for running it on the project.</p><p>Sonarqube identifies <em>code</em> smells in a given repository. Code smells are closely related to design smells, but are more specific in nature. Make sure that you list design smells, not code smells. Note that Sonarqube is not perfect, use your own judgement wherever necessary</p><p><em>Task 2a - Identify 5-8 design smells in the project. Use the code smells identified by Sonarqube to support your analysis.</em></p><blockquote><p>PS - Sonarqube and the project itself require different Java versions to run. Instructions for handling this are provided in the project README</p></blockquote><h3 id="32b-code-metrics"> <a href="#32b-code-metrics" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="32b-code-metrics"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 3.2b Code Metrics</h3><p>Code metrics are objective, repeatable, empirical measure of a project’s properties. Many tools exist for computing these for software repositories such as Checkstyle, PMD etc. We will use some of these tools to get some metrics for our project in its initial state. You are free to use any tools you find fit for this purpose.</p><p><em>Task 2b - Report up to 6 code metrics for the project (and mention the tools used). What implications do you think these have? Do they guide your decision process for refactoring in any way?</em></p><h2 id="3-refactoring"> <a href="#3-refactoring" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="3-refactoring"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 3 Refactoring</h2><p>We have now thoroughly understood the organization and performance of our system. It’s finally time to get our hands dirty. In the previous task you have identified various metrics and design smells for the repository which inform us of the code quality and how well it works. There’s plenty of room for improvement, right? As the final part of this phase, we will address this.</p><h3 id="3a-design-smells"> <a href="#3a-design-smells" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="3a-design-smells"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 3a Design Smells</h3><p>You identified 5-8 design smells previously. We now to want to address these by refactoring the code to improve its design. Note that we do not want to throw away the previous code or fundamentally change its functionality.</p><p><em>Task 3a - Improve the code quality by refactoring it to remove the design smells identified. You don’t need to be exhaustive, but ensure that your refactoring is not trivial in nature. Remember that you should not change the program’s behavior. You will be evaluated on the correctness of your refactoring</em></p><h3 id="3b-code-metrics"> <a href="#3b-code-metrics" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="3b-code-metrics"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 3b Code Metrics</h3><p>Now that you’re done with refactoring, let’s see how the metrics have been impacted.</p><p><em>Task 3b - Remeasure the metrics previously measured after refactoring. Have they improved or worsened? Is the trend consistent across all metrics? Does this match your expectations? Also attempt to analyze what contributed to this.</em></p><h1 id="submission"> <a href="#submission" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="submission"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Submission</h1><p>The submission for this phase will be through GitHub classroom. The codebase will be automatically downloaded at the deadline, so ensure that everything is up in time. No exceptions will be granted.</p><p>In addition to the code changes required for Task 3a, you also need to submit a report containing your responses for each task. The report should be present in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs</code> directory, titled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase1_&lt;team_number&gt;.pdf</code>.</p><p>In addition to the responses, accurately report the contribution of each team member at the end of the report.</p><p>Soft deadline - 15th February, 2022</p><p>Hard deadline - 22nd February, 2022</p><p>Submissions made after the soft deadline will incur an additive 10% penalty for every day exceeded. No submissions will be accepted after the hard deadline.</p><p>As explained in class, no extensions will be granted. You can use late days as per the course policy documented in the course website.</p><hr><footer><p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">Copyright &copy; 2023 Karthik Vaidhyanathan.
